## Test Cases
Ensure that the modifications adhere to the following test cases:

1. **Transitions and Hover Effects:**
    - Implement smooth transitions to animate changes in properties such as color, background, and scale. Utilize the transition property to control the duration and easing of these effects.

    - For example, apply a hover effect on buttons that changes their background color, scale, and box-shadow when the user hovers over them

2. **Transforms for Interactive Elements:**
    - Use the transform property to modify the appearance of elements, such as scaling them up or down, translating their position, or rotating them.
    
    - In this project, you'll apply transforms to elements like buttons and images to create interactive effects that respond to user actions.


3. **Keyframe Animations:**
   - Create complex animations using the @keyframes rule. Define a sequence of steps to animate elements over time, such as moving bubbles across the screen or typing text effects.
   
   - Implement these animations to add motion and interest to static elements on the page.

4. **Animated Pseudo-Elements:**
   - Leverage pseudo-elements with keyframes and transitions to animate underlines or other decorative elements.
   
   - For instance, animate an underline that grows when the user hovers over a heading, enhancing the visual emphasis on the text.
5. **Custom Animation Sequences:**
   - Create custom animation sequences using @keyframes to choreograph the movement and appearance of different elements on the page.

   - Adjust the timing, delays, and easing functions to ensure animations feel smooth and cohesive.

## Modifications
