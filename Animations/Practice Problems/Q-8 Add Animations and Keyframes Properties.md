# Add Animations and Keyframes Properties

## Problem Statement
In this task, you have to create dynamic and visually appealing animations using CSS. You have to work with keyframe animations, transforms, and various animation properties to bring movement and interactivity to elements on a webpage.

## Test Cases
Ensure that the modifications adhere to the following test cases:

1. **Keyframe Animations:**
   - Define custom keyframe animations using the "@keyframes" rule to create unique movement patterns for different elements. For instance, create a sliding and bouncing effect, a rotating and scaling effect, and a sliding and fading effect for different boxes.

2. **CSS Transforms:**
    - Use the "transform" property to manipulate elements' position, rotation, and scale. Incorporate these transformations within your keyframe animations to achieve effects such as sliding across the screen, rotating around the centre, or scaling up and down.

3. **Animation Properties:**
   - Apply various animation properties such as "animation-duration", "animation-timing-function", "animation-iteration-count", "animation-delay", and "animation-direction" to control the timing, speed, and repetition of your animations. Experiment with these properties to fine-tune the behaviour of the animated boxes.

4. **Combining Effects:**
   - Combine different animation techniques to create complex animations that include multiple effects in sequence, such as sliding followed by scaling or rotating followed by fading.

5. **.wave-3**
   Ensure that the fourth circle element has an "animation-delay" property set to 0.6s

6. **keyframes**
   Ensure that the fifth circle element has an "animation-delay" property set to 0.8s

7. **keyframes**
Ensure that the keyframes for the bounce animation are defined correctly:
        - Ensure that the @keyframes bounce rule is defined in the CSS.
        - Ensure that the from keyframe has a "transform" property set to translateY(0).
        - Ensure that the to keyframe has a "transform" property set to translateY(-100px).

## Modifications
Make necessary adjustments to the HTML and CSS code to ensure responsiveness and achieve the expected output.
