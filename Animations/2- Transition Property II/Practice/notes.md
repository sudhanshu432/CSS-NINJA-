# CSS `transition-timing-function`

The `transition-timing-function` property in CSS defines the speed curve of a transition effect. It specifies how intermediate states of a transition should be calculated.

## 1. **Syntax**
The basic syntax for `transition-timing-function` is:

```css
transition-timing-function: keyword | cubic-bezier() | steps();
```

## 2. Keywords
CSS provides a few pre-defined timing function keywords that are commonly used.
**- ease**
```
transition-timing-function: ease;
```
This is the default value. It starts slowly, speeds up, and then slows down before completing the transition.

**- linear**
```
transition-timing-function: linear;
```
The transition progresses at a constant speed from start to end.

**- ease-in**
```
transition-timing-function: ease-in;
```
The transition starts slow and gradually speeds up.

**- ease-out**
```
transition-timing-function: ease-out;
```
The transition starts fast and slows down towards the end.


**- ease-in-out**
```
transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;
```
The transition starts slow, speeds up in the middle, and then slows down at the end.


## 3. Cubic Bezier Curves
You can define custom timing functions using the cubic-bezier() function, which takes four values between 0 and 1 representing control points for the curve.

**Example**
```
transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1);
```
This allows you to create complex timing functions. You can experiment with the control points to get the desired effect.

## 4. Steps Function
The steps() function divides the transition into equal parts.

**Example**
```
transition-timing-function: steps(4);
```
This would create a transition that moves in 4 equal steps, rather than a smooth continuous change.

## 5. Real-life Example
The steps() function divides the transition into equal parts.

**Example**
Imagine you're animating a car moving from point A to point B. Using different timing functions changes how the car moves:
    - With **linear**, the car moves at a constant speed.
    - With **ease-in**, the car starts slow but then speeds up.
    - With **ease-out**, the car starts fast and slows down towards the end.
Each of these functions can create a unique feel and effect in your animations, depending on the desired behavior.

## Conclusion
The transition-timing-function is a powerful tool that allows developers to control how transitions progress over time, adding a sense of realism and smoothness to web animations.
